Mithril is a proof of concept outlining the implementation of distributed computing into radar technology. This nodal system will contain an STM32 dev board, Raspberry Pi, and RF PCB per node. The RF PCB allows for FMCW and phased array radar functionality and is user programmable which allows for different nodes to influence its beam steering. The schematics can be found [here](/Schematics), and more details about our PCB and the explanations behind our design choices can be found on our [website](https://sites.google.com/stevens.edu/mbds/milestone-2?authuser=0). Simply put, the transmitter uses a VCO for signal synthesis, phase shifters for beamforming, and a power amplifier for propogation. The receiver uses a low noise amplifier to boost the antennas return signal, a mixer to downconvert our signals, and then baseband amplifying and filtering. This is then sampled by an STM32 dev board and processed by windowing and taking the FFT of our raw ADC data. We then send this over UART (subject to change to Ethernet) to a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pis are connected in a mesh network via the BatmanADV protocol allowing the Pis to send their FFT data using MQTT. The Pis can also send commands to the STM over UART to alter the phases of its nodes antennas, which is what allows our network of nodes to actively track objects based on each others findings.
