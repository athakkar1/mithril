Mithril is a nodal FMCW radar system that incorporates traditional FMCW radar,
digital processing, edge computing, and distributed networking. The initial idea of this 

As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:mithril_flowchart},
the radar was designed as a standalone PCB in ORCad, digital processing was handled by
STM microcontrollers, and distributed networking is done via Raspberry Pi's and the MQTT protocol.
All of these components were designed, engineered, and interfaced from scratch with a limited budget
of 2000 dollars.
